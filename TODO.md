-   production build where we put fonts that are actually used into a lockfile
-   using [data-uris](https://css-tricks.com/data-uris/) we can inline the fonts to achieve instant loading
-   another cool thing is to use css2?text= option where we first gather all the letters we actually use and then generate a font with only those letters
